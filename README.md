# IconsMergerGUI

Simple desktop app used to map icon packages for use by Blazorise.

## Overview

I have created this app so that I could easier map diferent icon packages, like FontAwesome and Material. Mapped icons are exported as generated code ready to be used by Blazorise component library.

Other than that it doesn't have any new value. But, if you find it useful for you use case please feel free to use the code.
